"console.log()" is the command to print something to the developer console in your browser. 
You can use this to print the results from any of the following articles and exercises to the console. 

Another way to include JavaScript in a webpage is through an external script. This is very similar to linking external CSS docs to your website.
  <script src="javascript.js"></script>

JavaScript files have the extension ".js" similar to .css for stylesheets. External JavaScript files are used for more complex scripts.

A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.
To create a variable in JavaScript, use the "let" keyword.

    # The statement below creates (in other words: declares) a variable with the name “message”:
    let message;

    # Now, we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator "=":
    message = 'Hello'

    # NOTE: we can declare AND assign variables on the same line
    let message = 'Hello'

    # We can now access the variable (Saves this variable in memory)
    alert(message); // shows the variable content

Delcaring twice will trigger an ERROR!

    let message = 'Hello"

    // Repeated "let"s leads to errors
    let message = 'World'

So, we should declare a variable once and then refer to it without let.

When variable name is multiple words use camelCase
    lowerstartUpper

$ and _ are valid naming conventions

    let $ = 1;
    let _ = 1;

    alert ($ + _); // 2

In prior versions of js, we can assign variables by mere assignment, it still works now id we dont "use strict" in our script

Works
    num = 5;
    alert num;

Does Not Work
    "use strict"

    num = 5; // Throws an error
